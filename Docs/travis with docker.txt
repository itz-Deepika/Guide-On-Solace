Using a Docker image from the repository in a build

This example repository runs two Docker containers built from the same image:

1. a Sinatra application
2. the Sinatra application test suite
After specifying in the .travis.yml to use Docker (with services: - docker) and Ruby (with language: ruby) , 
the before_install build step pulls a Docker image from carlad/sinatra then runs in a container built from that image after mapping some ports and paths.

The complete setting for the travis.yml file is:

language: ruby

services:
  - docker

before_install:
- docker pull carlad/sinatra
- docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:80:4567 carlad/sinatra /bin/sh -c "cd /root/sinatra; bundle exec foreman start;"
- docker ps -a
- docker run carlad/sinatra /bin/sh -c "cd /root/sinatra; bundle exec rake test"

script:
- bundle exec rake test
